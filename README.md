This page is my PHOTOSHOP PORTFOLIO of work completed while still in school.

From creating using different tools to editing and enhancing photographs, I have completed projects that showcase my ability 
to work with typography, color, and composition to create impactful designs that grab attention and communicate effectively.

With a focus on delivering high-quality work that exceeds expectations, I am always looking for new and exciting projects to take on. So let's connect!
